## Description

React Documentation recommends Class Based Styling

Inline Styling is especially useful when we want styles for certain React Elements to be updateed on the fly.     
The value in style must be a JS object: {key: value}    
injected using curly braces { }      
eg: 
```
<h1 style= {{ color: "red" }} >Hello World!</h1>
```
