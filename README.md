## Description
This project displays a basic heading "Hello World"       
Its property: color is and inline style.


## Notes

#### React Documentation recommends Class Based Styling
Inline Styling is less used, but may be useful.

Inline Styling is especially useful when we want styles for certain React Elements to be updateed on the fly.     
The value in style= must be a JS object: {key: value}    
injected using curly braces { }      
eg: 
```
<h1 style= {{ color: "red" }} >Hello World!</h1>
```

#### Properties

CSS Reference to the Properties that we can use:       
[CSS Properties](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/)    

CSS Properties are kebab-cased and JS properites are camelCased


## What I have learned with this project:      
* Inline Styling React Elements      
* How to use JS Properties  
* Using Properties: conversion between CSS and JS and how inject them    
* Update properties on the fly
